## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 27 requirements at quick depth
- [Roadmap]: Pre-build validation (export, token count, ChromaDB test) bundled into Phase 1 alongside infrastructure standup
- [Roadmap]: RAG strategy decision deferred to Phase 1 execution (measure first, then decide)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Gemini conversation export quality is the highest-risk unknown -- entire RAG pipeline depends on getting usable seed data
- [Phase 3]: ChromaDB as vector store -- well-established, but chunking strategy for chat logs needs validation with real data
